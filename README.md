# Health-Data-Analysis
# Introduction:
This repository gives a summary of the Python-based Health Data Analysis project.The analysis of appointment no-show data in the context of healthcare can offer insightful information on patient behavior, scheduling effectiveness, and areas for development.An EDA analysis was conducted in order to learn some crucial information about missed appointments and to recommend potential future measures to lower appointment no-shows.
# Dataset:
- A healthcare organization is mentioned in the dataset that was utilized for this study.
- It includes facts on the patient's appointment scheduling as well as other information about the patient, such as age, gender, and medical issues.

# Content:
Dataset, EDA Notebook and Powerpoint Presentation.

# Project Overview:
In this study, we examine healthcare information to learn more about the causes of missed visits. Python is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation. Gaining knowledge of the variables influencing no-shows will enable us to make suggestions that can really be put into practice to help people miss fewer appointments.

# To run the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
  [Optional] Other libraries based on the analysis requirements.

# Analysis:
The analysis involves the following steps:
- Preprocessing the data, which includes cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, and encoding categorical characteristics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and comprehending the properties of the data, investigating correlations between variables using both Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, and spotting possible patterns.
- Interpretation: Determining the main causes of no-shows by interpreting the findings of the analysis.

# Results:
The results of the analysis will include:
- Visualizations of the EDA's most important results; insights into what causes people to cancel appointments.
- Suggestions to cut down on missed appointments.

# Conclusion
- The following observations show that the SMS reminder service is ineffective
- A considerable proportion of patients do not receive SMS appointment reminders.
- Although a large number of young individuals receive SMS reminders, their low frequency of chronic conditions such as Diabetes and
- Hipertension makes them more likely to skip appointments.
- Males are significantly more likely than females to miss appointments when they consume alcohol, and they are the least likely to get SMS reminders.
- The majority of patients, regardless of their medical condition or handicap status, do not receive SMS reminders about impending appointments.
- Patients participating in scholarship programs have additional issues with SMS reminders, since a greater percentage of them do not
- receive notifications and are more likely to miss appointments.
  
Gender's Role:z
Females, regardless of age, have a larger proclivity to skip appointments, even when they have:
- Medical problems that are ongoing.
- Participation in scholarship programs.
- SMS reminders were sent.

Highly Disregarded Groups:
- Pediatric, extremely old, and disabled patients are the most neglected categories when it comes to appointment attendance, and some prevalent explanations are as follows:
- absence of SMS appointment reminders.
- Rarely do pediatric children have chronic illnesses.

Regular Patients:
- Patients who regularly keep their visits are above 50 in a sizable majority (75%) of cases.
- Patients in the age range of 50 to 100 years are less likely to miss appointments because they require active medical treatment and follow-ups for conditions like Hypertension and Diabetes.
